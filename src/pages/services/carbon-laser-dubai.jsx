This process exfoliates dead skin cells, reduces oil and impurities, stimulates collagen formation, and improves surface texture and tone."

Once the carbon particles penetrate pores and attach to debris, a specialized laser emits targeted pulses that vaporize the carbon, removing dead skin cells, impurities, and excess oil. The laser energy also stimulates collagen production, improving overall texture and tone.",
