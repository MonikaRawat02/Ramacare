          "description": "Laser hair bleaching at RamaCare Polyclinic in Dubai is a personalized cosmetic treatment that uses advanced laser technology to lighten the colour of unwanted hair — making it less noticeable and blending more naturally with the surrounding skin tone. It’s ideal for individuals who prefer lighter, finer looking hair without invasive removal.",

          "howPerformed": "After a clinical consultation and assessment of hair type and skin tone, a trained clinician uses a specialized laser device that emits controlled light energy. The laser energy is absorbed by the melanin pigment in the hair shafts, breaking it down and causing gradual lightening of the hair colour over multiple sessions. Protective eyewear and safety precautions are used during the procedure.",
          "preparation": "Patients are advised to present with clean skin in the treatment area and disclose any skin sensitivities, medications, or recent sun exposure. The clinician will review hair characteristics, discuss expected results, and outline any pre‑treatment care needed.",
          "followup": "Follow‑up sessions may be scheduled based on individual response and desired degree of hair lightening. Post‑treatment care includes protecting the area from excessive sun exposure and following any skin care guidance provided by the clinician.",
