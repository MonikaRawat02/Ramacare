            description: 'An analysis of an individual is a comprehensive health evaluation that studies how the body functions as a whole. In Ayurveda, this includes assessing your Prakriti (natural body constitution) and Vikriti (current imbalance). Instead of treating only symptoms, this analysis helps identify the real cause behind health issues. It forms the foundation for creating a customized treatment plan suited specifically to your body and health goals.'

          question: 'What is thyroid dysfunction?',
          answer: 'Thyroid dysfunction refers to conditions where the thyroid gland produces too much hormone (hyperthyroidism) or too little hormone (hypothyroidism). The thyroid gland regulates metabolism, energy levels, body temperature, heart rate, and many other bodily functions.'

          id: 4,
          question: 'How is thyroid dysfunction diagnosed?',

        },
        {
          id: 5,
          question: 'What is Hashimoto\'s disease?',
          answer: 'Hashimoto\'s disease (Hashimoto\'s thyroiditis) is an autoimmune condition where the immune system attacks the thyroid gland, leading to hypothyroidism. It is the most common cause of hypothyroidism and requires lifelong thyroid hormone replacement.'
        },
        {
          id: 6,
          question: 'What is Graves\' disease?',

        },
        {
          id: 7,
          question: 'How is hypothyroidism treated?',
          answer: 'Hypothyroidism is treated with thyroid hormone replacement medication (levothyroxine), taken daily. The dosage is adjusted based on thyroid function tests. Treatment is typically lifelong, and regular monitoring ensures optimal hormone levels.'
        },
        {
          id: 8,
          question: 'How is hyperthyroidism treated?',
          answer: 'Hyperthyroidism treatment options include antithyroid medications (to reduce hormone production), radioactive iodine (to destroy thyroid tissue), or surgery (thyroidectomy). The choice depends on the cause, severity, age, and patient preference.'
        },
        {
          id: 9,
          question: 'How long does it take to see results?',
          answer: 'With proper treatment, symptoms typically improve within 4-8 weeks. However, it may take several months to achieve optimal thyroid hormone levels. Regular monitoring and medication adjustments help ensure the best results.'
        },
        {
          id: 10,
          question: 'Do I need to take medication forever?',
          answer: 'For hypothyroidism, medication is typically lifelong. For hyperthyroidism, treatment duration varies - some patients may need long-term medication, while others may be cured with radioactive iodine or surgery. Your doctor will discuss your specific situation.'
        },

          id: 11,
          question: 'Can thyroid dysfunction affect weight?',
          answer: 'Yes, thyroid dysfunction significantly affects weight. Hypothyroidism often causes weight gain and difficulty losing weight. Hyperthyroidism causes weight loss despite increased appetite. Proper treatment helps normalize metabolism and weight.'
        },
        {
          id: 12,
          question: 'Can thyroid dysfunction affect fertility?',
          answer: 'Yes, thyroid dysfunction can affect fertility in both men and women. Untreated thyroid disorders may cause irregular periods, difficulty conceiving, and increased risk of miscarriage. Proper treatment improves fertility outcomes.'
        },
        {
          id: 13,
          question: 'Are there dietary restrictions for thyroid patients?',

The exact number depends on factors like skin type, hair color, treatment area, and individual response. Our dermatologists will provide a personalized treatment plan during your consultation.'

            question: 'Is laser treatment painful?',
            answer: 'Most patients describe the sensation as mild discomfort, similar to a rubber band snap. We use advanced cooling technology and can adjust settings for maximum comfort. Topical anesthesia is available for sensitive areas. The discomfort is minimal and well-tolerated by most patients.'

            question: 'Is laser treatment safe for all skin types?',
            answer: 'Modern laser technology can safely treat most skin types. We use different laser wavelengths and settings customized to your skin type and tone to ensure safe and effective treatment. Our dermatologists will assess your skin during consultation to determine the most appropriate laser and settings for you.'

            id: 5,
            question: 'What should I avoid before laser treatment?',
            answer: 'Avoid sun exposure, tanning, and certain skincare products (retinoids, AHAs, glycolic acid) for 2 weeks before treatment. Shave the treatment area 24 hours before hair removal sessions (do not wax or pluck). Avoid blood-thinning medications if possible. Our team will provide detailed pre-treatment instructions tailored to your specific treatment.'

            question: 'How long do laser treatment results last?',
            answer: 'Laser hair removal results are typically permanent after completing the full treatment course (95%+ hair reduction). Skin rejuvenation and pigmentation treatments provide long-lasting results, with maintenance sessions recommended annually or as needed. Results continue to improve over several months after treatment.'

            id: 8,
            question: 'Are there any side effects of laser treatment?',
            answer: 'Most patients experience minimal side effects such as temporary redness, mild swelling, or slight sensitivity immediately after treatment. These typically resolve within a few hours to a day. Rare side effects may include temporary hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation, which usually fade over time. Our team will provide post-treatment care instructions to minimize any side effects.'

            question: 'Can laser treatment be done during pregnancy?',
            answer: 'Laser treatment is generally not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding due to hormonal changes and safety precautions. We recommend waiting until after delivery and breastfeeding before starting laser treatments. Please consult with your obstetrician and our dermatologist for personalized advice.'

            answer: 'Most laser treatments have minimal to no downtime. You can return to normal activities immediately after treatment.

Our team will provide specific post-treatment care instructions.'

            question: 'Can laser treatment remove tattoos?',
            answer: 'Yes, we offer laser tattoo removal using Q-switched lasers that break down tattoo ink particles. Tattoo removal typically requires multiple sessions (6-12+ sessions) spaced 6-8 weeks apart. The number of sessions depends on tattoo size, colors, age, and location. Results vary and complete removal may not always be possible.'

Our dermatologists will create a comprehensive treatment plan that safely combines multiple procedures for optimal results.'

            id: 15,
            question: 'How do I prepare for my first laser treatment session?',
            answer: 'Before your first session: avoid sun exposure for 2 weeks, shave the treatment area 24 hours prior (for hair removal), stop using retinoids/AHAs 1 week before, arrive with clean skin (no makeup or lotions), and wear comfortable clothing. Our team will provide detailed preparation instructions during your consultation.'

            id: 1,
            question: 'What is body shaping in Dubai?',
            answer: 'Body shaping in Dubai refers to non-invasive treatments designed to reduce fat, tighten skin, and improve body contours without surgery. It includes technologies like CoolSculpting (cryolipolysis), radiofrequency skin tightening, ultrasound fat reduction, and EMS muscle toning. All treatments are performed by DHA-licensed specialists using FDA-approved equipment.'
          },
          {
            id: 2,
            question: 'How many body shaping sessions do I need?',
            answer: 'Most patients see visible results after 2-3 sessions, with optimal results after 4-6 sessions spaced 4-6 weeks apart. The exact number depends on your goals, treatment area, body type, and individual response. Results continue to improve over 3-6 months as the body processes eliminated fat cells.'
          },
          {
            id: 3,
            question: 'Is body shaping treatment painful?',
            answer: 'Most treatments involve minimal discomfort. CoolSculpting may cause initial cold sensation and mild pulling that subsides quickly. Radiofrequency treatments feel warm but are generally comfortable. EMS muscle toning may feel like intense exercise. We ensure your comfort throughout the procedure and can adjust settings as needed.'
          },
          {
            id: 4,
            question: 'When will I see results from body shaping?',
            answer: 'Initial results may be visible after 2-3 weeks, with more noticeable improvements after 4-6 weeks. Optimal results typically appear 2-3 months after treatment as the body naturally eliminates treated fat cells. Results continue to improve over 6 months. Skin tightening results may be visible sooner, while fat reduction takes longer as cells are eliminated.'
          },
          {
            id: 5,
            question: 'Can I combine different body shaping treatments?',
            answer: 'Yes, combining treatments often yields better results. For example, combining fat reduction (CoolSculpting) with skin tightening (radiofrequency) or muscle toning (EMS) can provide comprehensive body contouring. Our specialists will recommend the best combination for your specific goals and body type.'
          },
          {
            id: 6,
            question: 'Are body shaping results permanent?',
            answer: 'Fat reduction results are permanent as treated fat cells are eliminated and cannot regenerate. However, maintaining a healthy lifestyle with proper diet and exercise is important to prevent new fat accumulation in untreated areas. Skin tightening results can last 1-2 years with proper maintenance sessions.'
          },
          {
            id: 7,
            question: 'What areas can be treated with body shaping?',
            answer: 'Body shaping can be performed on almost any body area including abdomen, thighs, arms, back, flanks (love handles), double chin, bra fat, and more. Different technologies are used for different areas. Our specialists will assess your body and recommend the best treatment areas for your goals.'
          },
          {
            id: 8,
            question: 'Is body shaping safe for all body types?',
            answer: 'Body shaping is generally safe for most body types. However, ideal candidates are those close to their ideal weight with specific problem areas. Very overweight individuals may need to lose weight first. We assess each patient during consultation to determine suitability and create a safe, effective treatment plan.'
          },
          {
            id: 9,
            question: 'What should I avoid before body shaping treatment?',
            answer: 'Avoid blood-thinning medications (aspirin, ibuprofen) for 1 week before treatment if possible. Stay hydrated and maintain a healthy diet. Avoid alcohol 24 hours before treatment. Wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing. Our team will provide detailed pre-treatment instructions during your consultation.'
          },
          {
            id: 10,
            question: 'What is the downtime after body shaping?',
            answer: 'Most body shaping treatments have no downtime. You can return to normal activities immediately after treatment. Some patients may experience mild redness, swelling, or tenderness that resolves within a few hours to days. We recommend avoiding strenuous exercise for 24-48 hours after treatment.'
          },
          {
            id: 11,
            question: 'Can body shaping help after pregnancy?',
            answer: 'Yes, body shaping is excellent for post-pregnancy body restoration. It can help reduce stubborn fat deposits, tighten loose skin, and improve muscle tone. However, we recommend waiting until at least 6 months postpartum and after breastfeeding (if applicable) before starting treatments. Consult with your obstetrician first.'

          {
            id: 12,
            question: 'How much does body shaping cost in Dubai?',
            answer: 'Body shaping costs vary based on treatment area, number of sessions, and technology used. We offer transparent pricing with package deals for multiple sessions. Pricing starts from AED 3,500 for single area packages. During your consultation, we will provide a detailed cost estimate based on your specific treatment plan.'
          },
          {
            id: 13,
            question: 'Is body shaping a substitute for weight loss?',
            answer: 'No, body shaping is not a weight loss solution. It is designed for body contouring and reducing stubborn fat in specific areas. Ideal candidates are close to their ideal weight but have problem areas resistant to diet and exercise. We recommend maintaining a healthy lifestyle alongside treatments for best results.'
          },
          {
            id: 14,
            question: 'Can men benefit from body shaping treatments?',
            answer: 'Absolutely! Body shaping is equally effective for men. Common treatment areas for men include abdomen, chest (gynecomastia), flanks, and double chin. Men often see excellent results with CoolSculpting and muscle toning treatments. Our specialists have extensive experience treating male patients.'
          },
          {
            id: 15,
            question: 'How do I maintain body shaping results?',
            answer: 'Maintain results by following a healthy diet, regular exercise, staying hydrated, and maintaining a stable weight. We may recommend maintenance sessions every 6-12 months depending on your treatment. Our team provides lifestyle guidance and support to help you maintain your results long-term.'

            question: 'How many sessions are needed for teeth bleaching?',
            answer: ' Most patients achieve noticeable results in a single session. Severe discoloration may require 1–2 additional sessions for optimal brightness and even tooth shade.'
          },

            id: 7,
            question: 'Will teeth bleaching cause sensitivity?',
            answer: 'Mild temporary sensitivity may occur in some patients but usually resolves within 24–48 hours. Dentists provide post-treatment care instructions to minimize discomfort effectively.'

            id: 8,
            question: 'Can teeth bleaching remove all stains?',

            id: 9,
            question: 'How long do the results of teeth bleaching last?',
            answer: 'With proper care, results can last 1–3 years. Avoiding staining foods and drinks, maintaining oral hygiene, and periodic touch-ups help preserve the brightness longer.'

            id: 10,
            question: 'Are teeth bleaching better than home whitening kits?',
            answer: ' Yes, professional teeth bleaching delivers faster, safer, and more consistent results. Home kits often cause uneven whitening, longer treatment time, and a higher risk of tooth sensitivity.'
          },

            id: 11,
            question: 'Can teeth bleaching be done on sensitive teeth?',

            id: 12,
            question: 'Does teeth bleaching damage enamel?',
            answer: ' No, professional bleaching performed under a dentist\'s supervision uses enamel-safe gels. Overuse of home kits may harm enamel, so professional treatment ensures safety and lasting results.'
          },

            id: 13,
            question: 'How much does teeth bleaching cost in Dubai?',

          {
            id: 15,
            question: ' Where can I get professional teeth bleaching in Dubai?',

          {
            id: 1,
            question: 'What are composite veneers in Dubai?',
            answer: 'Composite veneers in Dubai are thin layers of tooth-colored composite resin that are directly bonded to the front of your teeth to improve their appearance. They can correct stains, chips, gaps, and shape issues in a single visit at a DHA-licensed clinic.'
          },
          {
            id: 2,
            question: 'How long do composite veneers last?',
            answer: 'Composite veneers typically last 5-7 years with proper care, good oral hygiene, and avoiding habits like teeth grinding or biting hard objects. Regular dental check-ups can extend their lifespan.'
          },
          {
            id: 3,
            question: 'Are composite veneers painful?',
            answer: 'Composite veneers are generally painless. Minimal or no tooth preparation is needed, and local anesthesia is rarely required. Most patients experience no discomfort during or after the procedure.'
          },
          {
            id: 4,
            question: 'How long does the composite veneers procedure take?',
            answer: 'The procedure takes 60-90 minutes per tooth. For a smile makeover with multiple veneers, the entire process can be completed in one 3-4 hour visit or split across two visits for patient comfort.'
          },
          {
            id: 5,
            question: 'Can composite veneers be removed?',
            answer: 'Yes, composite veneers can be removed more easily than porcelain veneers. The dentist can polish them off, and your natural teeth remain largely intact since minimal preparation is involved.'
          },
          {
            id: 6,
            question: 'Do composite veneers stain?',
            answer: 'Composite veneers are more prone to staining than porcelain but are still stain-resistant. Avoiding coffee, tea, red wine, and tobacco helps maintain their appearance. Regular polishing can remove surface stains.'
          },
          {
            id: 7,
            question: 'What is the difference between composite and porcelain veneers?',
            answer: 'Composite veneers are applied in one visit, more affordable, require minimal preparation, and are easily repairable. Porcelain veneers take multiple visits, cost more, require more tooth preparation, but are more stain-resistant and durable.'
          },
          {
            id: 8,
            question: 'Are composite veneers suitable for everyone?',
            answer: 'Composite veneers are suitable for most people wanting to improve their smile. However, they may not be ideal for those with severe tooth damage, extensive decay, or very dark stains. A consultation will determine if they are right for you.'
          },
          {
            id: 9,
            question: 'How much do composite veneers cost in Dubai?',
            answer: 'The cost of composite veneers in Dubai depends on the number of teeth, complexity, and the dentist\'s experience. Prices typically range from AED XXX to AED XXX per tooth, making them more affordable than porcelain veneers.'
          },
          {
            id: 10,
            question: 'Can composite veneers fix gaps between teeth?',
            answer: 'Yes, composite veneers can effectively close small to moderate gaps between teeth by building up the tooth structure, creating a more uniform and aesthetically pleasing smile.'
          },
          {
            id: 11,
            question: 'Do composite veneers require special care?',
            answer: 'Composite veneers require standard oral hygiene—regular brushing, flossing, and dental check-ups. Avoid biting hard objects, grinding teeth, and excessive consumption of staining foods or drinks to maintain their appearance.'
          },
          {
            id: 12,
            question: 'Can composite veneers be whitened?',
            answer: 'Composite veneers cannot be whitened with traditional teeth whitening methods. If they become stained or discolored, they can be polished or replaced. It\'s best to whiten your natural teeth first, then match the veneers to the desired shade.'
          },
          {
            id: 13,
            question: 'How are composite veneers applied?',
            answer: 'Composite veneers are applied by cleaning and preparing the tooth surface, applying a bonding agent, layering composite resin material, shaping it to the desired form, curing it with a special light, and then polishing to achieve a natural finish.'
          },
          {
            id: 14,
            question: 'Are composite veneers covered by insurance?',
            answer: 'Composite veneers are typically considered cosmetic procedures and may not be covered by basic dental insurance. Some premium dental plans may offer partial coverage. It\'s best to check with your insurance provider.'
          },
          {
            id: 15,
            question: 'Where can I get composite veneers in Dubai?',
            answer: 'You can get composite veneers at DHA-licensed cosmetic dental clinics in Dubai, such as Rama Care Polyclinic, which offers experienced cosmetic dentists, same-day results, and affordable smile transformation services.'

            question: 'What are metal and ceramic braces?',
            answer: 'Metal braces use stainless steel brackets and wires, while ceramic braces use tooth-colored or clear brackets. Both effectively straighten teeth, with metal being more visible and affordable, and ceramic offering better aesthetics at a slightly higher cost.'
          },
          {
            id: 2,
            question: 'How long do braces take to work?',
            answer: 'Braces treatment typically takes 18–36 months, depending on the complexity of the case, age of the patient, and adherence to treatment. Most patients see noticeable improvements within 3–6 months of starting treatment.'
          },
          {
            id: 3,
            question: 'Do braces hurt?',
            answer: 'You may experience mild discomfort or pressure for a few days after braces installation and after adjustments. This is normal and can be managed with over-the-counter pain relievers. The discomfort typically subsides quickly.'
          },
          {
            id: 4,
            question: 'What is the difference between metal and ceramic braces?',
            answer: 'Metal braces are more visible but stronger and more affordable. Ceramic braces are less noticeable, offering better aesthetics, but are slightly more fragile and expensive. Both are equally effective in correcting orthodontic issues.'
          },
          {
            id: 5,
            question: 'Can adults get braces?',
            answer: 'Yes, adults can definitely get braces. Many adults choose braces to correct alignment issues, improve oral health, or enhance their smile. Treatment may take slightly longer for adults but is equally effective.'
          },
          {
            id: 6,
            question: 'How often do I need to visit the orthodontist?',
            answer: 'After initial installation, you typically need monthly adjustment appointments. These visits allow the orthodontist to tighten wires, monitor progress, and make necessary adjustments to ensure optimal results.'
          },
          {
            id: 7,
            question: 'What foods should I avoid with braces?',
            answer: 'Avoid hard foods (nuts, hard candy), sticky foods (gum, caramel), and foods that require biting (corn on cob, apples). Cut food into small pieces and maintain good oral hygiene to prevent damage to braces.'
          },
          {
            id: 8,
            question: 'How do I clean my teeth with braces?',
            answer: 'Brush after every meal using a soft-bristled toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste. Use interdental brushes to clean around brackets and floss threaders for flossing. Regular professional cleanings are also important.'
          },
          {
            id: 9,
            question: 'Are ceramic braces as effective as metal braces?',
            answer: 'Yes, ceramic braces are equally effective as metal braces in correcting orthodontic issues. The treatment duration and results are the same; the main difference is aesthetics and cost.'
          },
          {
            id: 10,
            question: 'How much do braces cost in Dubai?',
            answer: 'The cost of braces in Dubai depends on the type (metal or ceramic), complexity of the case, and treatment duration. Metal braces typically range from AED XXX to AED XXX, while ceramic braces are slightly higher. We offer flexible payment plans.'
          },
          {
            id: 11,
            question: 'Can braces fix overbite or underbite?',
            answer: 'Yes, braces can effectively correct overbites, underbites, and crossbites. In some cases, additional appliances or treatment may be needed, which will be discussed during your consultation.'
          },
          {
            id: 12,
            question: 'What happens after braces are removed?',
            answer: 'After braces removal, you will receive a retainer to wear as instructed. Retainers help maintain the new tooth position and prevent teeth from shifting back. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor retention.'
          },
          {
            id: 13,
            question: 'Are braces covered by insurance?',
            answer: 'Some dental insurance plans cover orthodontic treatment, especially for children. Coverage varies by plan and provider. We can help you check your insurance coverage and provide necessary documentation for claims.'
          },
          {
            id: 14,
            question: 'Can I play sports with braces?',
            answer: 'Yes, you can play sports with braces, but it\'s recommended to wear a mouthguard to protect your braces and teeth from injury. Your orthodontist can provide a custom-fitted mouthguard.'
          },
          {
            id: 15,
            question: 'Where can I get braces in Dubai?',
            answer: 'You can get metal and ceramic braces at Rama Care Polyclinic, a DHA-licensed orthodontic clinic in Dubai. We offer experienced orthodontists, comprehensive treatment plans, and flexible payment options for optimal results.'

            question: 'How much does crown and bridge treatment cost in Dubai?',
